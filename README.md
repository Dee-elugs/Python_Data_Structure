## 🐍 **Python Data Structures & Algorithm Practice**

A hands-on Python project focused on strengthening your foundational programming skills through a variety of exercises centered around core data structures and algorithms.

> ## 💻  **Developed using** **Visual Studio Code**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

This project is designed to help learners:
- Practice manipulating Python’s built-in data structures such as **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries**, and **sets**.
- Understand basic algorithmic concepts through real coding challenges.
- Improve their problem-solving skills by implementing clean and efficient Python solutions.

## 📦 **What's Included**

The exercises in this repository explore:
- Mathematical operations using lists
- Tuple sorting and custom key logic
- Dictionary merging and transformation
- Iteration and conditionals
- Dictionary comprehension and value mapping
- Sorting techniques for complex data types
- Set operations such as creation, iteration, addition, and deletion

Each script is self-contained and focused on a specific programming concept, making it easy to learn and adapt to your needs.
